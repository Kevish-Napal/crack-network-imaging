# Crack Density Imaging via Acoustic Scattering

This MATLAB project implements two inversion algorithms for imaging crack networks using acoustic far-field data. The code computes novel indicator functions sensitive to local crack density, enabling quantitative evaluation of damage in complex materials. The results from this code are featured in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10342) published in SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing.
